I am a first-year PhD student at University of Amsterdam, jointly in Amsterdam Business School and MultiX lab in Informatics Institute. I luckily get business-related supervision from [Dr. Monika Kackovic](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/k/a/m.kackovic/m.kackovic.html) and [Prof. dr. Nachoem Wijnberg](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/w/i/n.m.wijnberg/n.m.wijnberg.html), and technical supervision from [Dr. Stevan Rudinac](https://stevanrudinac.com/) and  [Prof. dr. Marcel Worring](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.worring/). My research focuses on (Hyper)graph learning, Multimodal, and their applications combined with business theory in Science and Cultural industry. 

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam (Cum Laude), with my thesis on sign language processing supervised by [Dr. Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io/). I was also an AI intern at Shell Technology Center and a research assistant on Computer graphics. Before that, I did my Bachelorâ€™s in Aerospace Engineering focused on Computational fluid dynamics at Shenyang Aerospace university.
